 Analyzing the radioactive decay of elements and modeling the decay and energy created from this process. The elements used were:

\noindent {\bf PROCEDURE:} \\

My procedure for this project was to start from the bottom with Lead $^{207}$, and work my way up the ladder. For example, I examined the decay of Bismuth, 87\% of it turns into Lead $^{207}$, while 13\% of it turns into Thallium. Then, I broke down each decay time into seconds by multiplying the given minutes by 60, representing 60 seconds, but for Radon, I multiplied its given time, 3,82 days, by 24 hours, 60 minutes, and 60 seconds. Thirdly, I produced half-life equations for all the elements.

\noindent {\bf ANALYSIS (and math):} \\

%And go into Math mode $A_x = \int_{n-1}^{n+10}  f(x) \mathrm{d}x$ 
%in the normal text or insert an equation:
%\begin{equation}
%	F = ma \\
%	   =m \frac{dv}{dt} 
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    N(t) = N(0) 2^{-t/\tau}
    \label{eq:placeholder_label}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    p(t) = 1 - 2^{-t/\tau}
    \label{eq:placeholder_label}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    x = \frac{1}{\mu} \ln(1 - z)
    \label{placeholder}
\end{equation}
%or if you want to go wild:
%\begin{equation}
%\prod_{j\ge0}\left( \sum_{k\ge0} a_{jk}z^k \right) = %\sum_{n\ge0} z^n 
%\left( \sum_{k_0,k_1\ldots\ge0 \atop k_0+k_1\cdots=0} a_{0k_0} %a_{1k_1}\ldots \right)
%\end{equation}
%and continue your text.

\noindent {\bf RESULTS:}\\

The following graph outlines the results from the average and standard deviations of individual and total decay energies produced.  %You can also use tables to display your data.\\

% Tables are created easily

\begin{tabular}{|l|crrrr|}\hline\hline
Alpha energy & Beta Energy & R Energy & Z Energy & Total Energy &\\\hline\hline

\noindent {\bf CONCLUSION:}\\

In conclusion, a shield of about 63.81 cm would be needed to safely block all alpha energy, and the amount of energy needed to block up to 3-sigma is, 111661.58753821626.
