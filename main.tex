\section{}
{An electron is to be found in the spin state (in the z-basis): $\chi = A \begin{pmatrix}3i\\4\end{pmatrix}$}
\\
\indent{(a) (5 points) Determine if the possible values of A such that the state is normalized}.
\\
(b) (5 points) Find the expectation values of the operators {\color{red}\textit{$S_x$}}, {\color{purple}\textit{$S_y$}}, {\color{orange}\textit{$S_z$}} and \textit{${\Vec{S}}^2$}.
\\
{The matrix representations in the $z$-basis for the components of electron spin operators are given by:}
\\
{{\color{red}\textbf{$S_x=\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix}0\ 1\\1\ 0\end{pmatrix};$}  \color{purple}\textbf{$S_y=\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix}0\ -i\\i\ \ \ \ 0\end{pmatrix};$} \color{orange}\textbf{$S_z=\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1\ \ \ \ \  0\\0\ -1\end{pmatrix}$}}
\\
{2. The average electrostatic field in the earth's atmosphere in the fair weather is approximately given:}
\begin{equation}
    {\Vec{E}} = E_0(Ae^{-\alpha}{z}+Be^{-{\beta}{z}},
\end{equation}
\\
where $A$,$B$,{$\alpha$}, {$\beta$} are positive constants and $z$ is the height above the (locally flat) earth surface.
\\
{(a) (5 points) Find the average charge density in the atmosphere as a function of height}.
\\
{(b) (5 points) Find the electric potential as a function height above the earth}.
\\
{3. \textbf{The following questions refer to stars in the Table below.}}
\\
{Note: There may be multiple answers}.
